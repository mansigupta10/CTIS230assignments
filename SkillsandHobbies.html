    <h2><strong>SKILLS AND HOBBIES</strong></h2>
    <h3><strong>Swimming</strong></h3>
    <p>I have swam on the Kernersville Riptyde and SwimTyde team since I was 8 years old. I have recieved up to first
        place medals in regional and championship competitions. My speciality strokes include 200 IM, 100 Butterfly, and
        500 Freestyle. Swimming is an important skill I have developed and keeps me active and, throughout high school,
        swimming was my essential form of stress relief. I hope to continue swimming throughout college. </p>
    <h3><strong>Tennis</strong></h3>
    <p>I have played tennis since I was 8 years old as well. I played with the Spencer Love Tennis Team and the
        Greensboro Tennis Association up until tenth grade. I have placed in regional and state competitions and even
        taught
        tennis to younger kids between 2014-2016. Since tenth grade, tennis has remained a hobby and I play it often to
        stay active. I also hope to continue playing tennis through a club team in college. </p>
    <h3><strong>Bharatanatyam</strong></h3>
    <p>Bharatanatyam is a form of Indian Classical dance that I have learned since I was 6 years old. This is one of my
        oldest and most advanced hobbies. Bharatanatyam has kept me connected to my culture and roots, while icreasing
        flexibility and grace. I have performed in Indian cultural events throughout North Carolina and plan to continue
        on a fusion dance team in college. </p>
    <h3><strong>Running</strong></h3>
    <p>I had developed a passion in running in ninth grade, but recently began to run more in my senior year. I planned
        to complete a full marathon (26 miles) in June and was training for that but due to the COVID-19 situation the
        marathon is pending. Nevertheless, running is something I do on a daily basis to increase my cardiovascular
        function and help stay energized. </p>
    <h3><strong>Teaching and Tutoring</strong></h3>
    <p>I have engaged in teaching and tutoring since the beginning of high school. My job at Eye Level includes teaching
        children between the ages of 4 to 18 regarding Math, English, SAT, ACT, and EOG topics. Along with that,
        through the Indo-American Society of North Carolina I teach students about Indian culture and teach different
        forms of Indian dance including Bharatanatyam and Bollywood. I have been involved in many teaching camps
        including IT is for Girls, where I teach STEM topics to girls in middle school as well Hindi School where I
        teach students how to read, write, and speak Hindi.</p>
    <h3><strong>Learning Languages</strong></h3>
    <p>I am currently fluent in Hindi and English, because those are my first languages and I learned them as I grew up.
        Furthermore, I am currently advanced in Spanish and have recently completed Spanish 202, the equivalent of
        Spanish 4 in high school. Along with that I have been learning Punjabi and American Sign Language in my free
        time. ASL is important to expand my communication with people across world and Punjabi is the language that is
        spoken on my mother's side of the family, so I believe both languages will be extremely important in my future.
    </p>
    <h3><strong>Upcycling Clothing</strong></h3>
    <p>Upcycling clothing is a skill I developed recently. It includes thrifting or buying simple pieces of clothing and
        making them more complicated or unique through cutting and stitching up various parts of the piece. Usually, I
        do this in my free time and I have made shoes, pants, blouses, and more that I enjoy wearing regularly.
        Currently, I have upcylced almost 30 pieces of clothings. </p>
    <h3><strong>Knitting and Crocheting</strong></h3>
    <p>I learned how to knit and crochet when I was 12 years old from my grandmother. Since then I have enjoyed knitting
        and crocheting clothes for my friends and family. I enjoy making sweaters and scarves, as well as embroidering
        small details in clothes. I usually combine this skill when I upcycle clothing or when I need to hem/make Indian
        outfits for cultural festivals.</p>
    <h3><strong>Baking and Cooking</strong></h3>
    <p>Baking and cooking is an important tradition in my culture, so I have learned a variety of Indian recipes from my
        mother and grandmother. Because of my extensive knowledge in Indian recipes, I have ventured to learn more
        recipes outside of that realm and into new cultures, such as Mexican, Italian, Greek, and Chinese foods.</p>
