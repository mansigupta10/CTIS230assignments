    <h2><strong>ABOUT ME</strong></h2>
    <p>Welcome to my website about me! This website showcases my interests and what I have accomplished throughout high
        school. The main sections include my Statistics, Leadership, Service, Scholar Awards/Activites, and
        Hobbies/Skills.</p>
    <p>Currently I am 17 years old and am completing my last year at the Early College of Guilford. My high school
        provided the oppurtunity to take classes at Guilford College during my junior and senior year.</p>
    <p>I plan to attend the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill as part of the Class of 2024 with a major in
        Neuroscience or Clinical Laboratory Sciences and a minor in Spanish and Medicine, Literature, and Culture. I
        hope join club sports, participate in research, shadow doctors, scribe, volunteer, study abroad, and much more!
    </p>
    <p>After college, I hope to attend medical school as a MD student and become an oncologist or radiation oncologist
        eventually!
