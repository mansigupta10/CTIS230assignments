    <p><strong>Welcome!</strong></p>
    <p class="intro">My website showcases my interests and what I have accomplished throughout high school broken
        into Statistics, Classes, Leadership Information, Service/Volunteering, Honors/Awards, and Skills/Hobbies.</p>

    <p class="aboutme">Currently, I am 17 years old and am completing my last year at the Early College of Guilford. My
        high school
        provided the oppurtunity to take classes at Guilford College during my junior and senior year. Therefore, I have
        completed a mix of Honors, AP, and College-Credit classes.</p>
    <p class="aboutme">I plan to attend the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill as part of the Class of 2024
        with a major in
        Neuroscience or Clinical Laboratory Sciences and a minor in Spanish and Medicine, Literature, and Culture. At
        UNC, I hope to join club sports, participate in research, shadow doctors, scribe, volunteer, study abroad, and
        much more! </p>
    <p class="aboutme">After college, I hope to attend medical school as a MD student and become an oncologist or
        radiation oncologist in the future!
        <p class="conclusion">Feel free to email me if you have any questions and enjoy the various gifs I have
            included!</p>
